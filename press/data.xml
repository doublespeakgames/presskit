		<history>
			<header>Founding</header>
			<text>In 2013, Michael Townsend made a browser game in his spare time. He called it A Dark Room, threw up a simple website, and doublespeak games was founded. It was an unexpected viral hit, getting wide attention across the internet. A post on HackerNews got the attention of Amir Rajan, who reached out to Townsend asking for permission to bring A Dark Room to iOS. Townsend agreed and, less than a year later, A Dark Room was charting #1 in the American App Store.</text>

			<text>Despite the windfall from A Dark Room, doublespeak continued to be a side project for many years. In this time, the one-man studio released a match-3 survival RPG called Gridland, its remastered mobile edition Super Gridland, and an abstract strategy game called Rad√ºm. With more ambitious projects in mind, however, doublespeak began to strain against the limitation of being a hobby. In 2018, Townsend made a budget, held his breath, and left his professional career to focus on making games full-time.</text>

    <history>
			<header>Future</header>
			<text>With newfound freedom, doublespeak began experimenting with different types of narrative-based games. Several concepts were prototyped, iterated on, and discarded before something stuck. In mid-2019, development began in earnest on what would be doublespeak's largest relase, a 50,000 word non-linear narrative game called Penrose. While work on Penrose was steady over the following year, doublespeak continued to experiment with narrative in gaming, releasing a voice-controlled adventure game for Google Assistant called A Flight of Fancy.</text>
