Presskit() (*do-presskit*) is a great library for making presskits, game dev or not. Surprisingly, there isn't much help on a Node.js installation. I wanted a Node.js installation. So I made one.

**NOTE:** This library does automatically download presskit() related files straight to your server. If you are not comfortable with this, and want to get it manually, simply use the secondary function `presskit.manual(app);`.

`php` must be in your path. Just run `php` in your terminal and see if there is an error. If not, you're good to go!
### Usage
```
var presskit = require('dopresskit-express');

// express declaration, so you have an "app" object

presskit.install(app);

// What if I don't want automatic downloads?
// That's OK! Just use manualInstall() with the location of your install.php.
presskit.manualInstall(app, "./presskit/install.php");

// listen for a "complete" signal
presskit.on('complete', function() {
  console.log("Completed! Go to http://(domain and/or port)/install.php!");
}
```

After that, go to `http://(domain and/or port)/install.php`. You should be find the installation instructions, and a bunch of stuff should automatically be initialized! Congrats, you have a presskit()!
